# Project README

## Project Overview
This project is a React Native application that adheres to best coding practices by incorporating a combination of ESLint for linting and Prettier for code formatting. It is designed to create a smooth development experience, ensuring that code is clean, readable, and follows established style guidelines.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage
After installation, you can start the development server by running:
```bash
npm start
```
This will launch the React Native packager, allowing you to run the app on your prefered device or emulator.

## Features
- **Code Quality:** Integrated ESLint for identifying potential coding issues.
- **Consistent Formatting:** Prettier ensures uniform code style across the entire project.
- **React Hooks Support:** Compliance with the latest React practices via recommended rules for hooks.
- **Customizable Rules:** Ability to adapt linting and formatting rules through configuration files.

## Dependencies
The project leverages the following major dependencies as specified in the `package.json`:

- **@react-native-community:** Extends React Native community style guide.
- **eslint:** A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns in JavaScript code.
- **eslint-plugin-react:** React specific linting rules for ESLint.
- **eslint-plugin-react-hooks:** Linting rules for React hooks.
- **eslint-config-prettier:** Disables ESLint rules that might conflict with Prettier.
- **prettier:** An opinionated code formatter.

(Note: The specific versions of dependencies can be found in the `package.json` file.)

## Project Structure

├── .prettierrc.js         # Prettier configuration file
├── package.json            # Project manifest and dependencies
```

This structure allows for easy navigation and modular configuration of both linting and formatting, ensuring consistent coding standards are maintained throughout the project.
